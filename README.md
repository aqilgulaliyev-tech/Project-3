# Personal Portfolio Website (SITE 1101 Project)

This repo scaffolds a simple, responsive personal website that meets the SITE 1101 Individual Project requirements.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home (profile intro and hero)
- `about.html` — About (background, skills, timeline)
- `projects.html` — Projects (cards; Project 1 placeholder included)
- `contact.html` — Extra page (contact + CTA section)

## Features
- Shared navigation bar and footer with GitHub/Codecademy icons and a repo link
- Responsive layout with mobile nav toggle
- Placeholder project card and sections you can edit
- Clean structure: `assets/css/styles.css`, `assets/js/main.js`

## Quick start
1. Open the folder in VS Code/Cursor.
2. Use Live Server (or any static server) to preview: open `index.html`.
3. Edit text, links, and images (search for TODO markers).
4. Commit regularly: `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a public GitHub repo and push this code.
2. In GitHub settings, enable Pages for the `main` branch (root).
3. Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/` (or `/site1101`).
4. Update the “GitHub Repo” link in the nav/footer to point to your repo.

## Customization tips
- Replace the placeholder profile photo (`.profile-photo` background) with your own.
- Add real project images by replacing the placeholder background in `.project-thumb`.
- Update social/profile links in the footer and hero buttons.
- Adjust colors and spacing in `assets/css/styles.css`.
